# ScirraConstruct-Examples
Some example games made with the Scirra Construct 2 game engine

# Background
Scirra Construct 2 and Construct 3 are game engines which allow to create 2D games that run in a web browser. These engines support a relatively modest range of functions compared to Unity and Unreal, but allow for quicker prototyping. Here I present games I made with Construct 2 (it should be possible to also open the projects in Construct 3, which is backwards-compatible). 

# Examples
## Football 
A simple football game for two players. Click [here](https://mariusrubo.github.io/football/) to play it. 
The entire project is saved in the file football.capx in this repo. Its logic only consists of 33 events, so you can open the project even in the free version of Construct 2 and Construct 3 (100 events limit).

## Ms. Caterpillar
A physics-based platformer. Click [here](https://mariusrubo.github.io/Caterpillar/) to play it. 

This project is more complex as it models the forces within a system of springs (the caterpillar's body) and their interaction with the forces inside a trampoline.

## Physics Learning Game
A learning game for basic Newtonian Mechanics and Kinematics. Click [here](https://mariusrubo.github.io/PhysicsLearningGame/) to play it. 

The game tries to show basic concepts in the field physics in a fun way. Players move around in interactive 2D environments where abstract concepts are continously displayed (e.g. as arrows). Players are prompted to investigate certain relations between these concepts as they play, and to then answer multiple-choice questions to check on their progress.

Note that the entire text in this game is in German. I thank the *MFG Stiftung Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg* who funded this project in 2012. 
Note: Chapter 4 currently does not start under Java 8.
