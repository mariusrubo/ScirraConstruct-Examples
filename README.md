# ScirraConstruct-Examples
Some examples of what can be achieved with the Scirra Construct 2 or Construct 3 game engine

# Background
Scirra Construct 2 and Construct 3 are nice 2D game engines which allow to create simple games which can be run in a browser. The engines are very beginner-friendly as they use visual scripting and only support a more modest range of functions compared to Unity and Unreal. Here I present some simple games I made with Construct 2.

# Examples
## Football 
The first game is a simple football simulation for two players. Click [here](https://github.com/mariusrubo/ScirraConstruct-Examples/blob/master/football/index.html) to play.
