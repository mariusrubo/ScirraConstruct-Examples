# ScirraConstruct-Examples
Some examples of what can be achieved with the Scirra Construct 2 or Construct 3 game engine

# Background
Scirra Construct 2 and Construct 3 are 2D game engines which allow to create simple games which can run in a browser. The engines are very beginner-friendly as they use visual scripting and only support a relatively modest range of functions compared to Unity and Unreal. Here I present some simple games I made with Construct 2.

# Examples
## Football 
The first game (football) is a simple football simulation for two players.
The second game (caterpillar) is a physics-based platformer.
