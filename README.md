# ScirraConstruct-Examples
Some examples of what can be achieved with the Scirra Construct 2 or Construct 3 game engine

# Background
Scirra Construct 2 and Construct 3 are 2D game engines which allow to create simple games that run in a browser. The engines are rather beginner-friendly as they use visual scripting and only support a relatively modest range of functions compared to Unity and Unreal. Here I present some simple games I made with Construct 2.

# Examples
## Football 
A simple football game for two players. Click [here](https://mariusrubo.github.io/football/) to play it. 
The entire project is saved in the file football.capx in this repo. Its logic only consists of 33 events, so you can open the project even in the free version of Construct 2 and Construct 3 (100 events limit).

## Ms. Caterpillar
A physics-based platformer. Click [here](https://mariusrubo.github.io/Caterpillar/) to play it. 

This project is more complex and can only be run in paid versions of Construct 2 or Construct 3. Please contact me personally if you would like to use this project.

## Physics Learning Game
A learning game for basic Newtonian Mechanics and Kinematics. Click [here](https://mariusrubo.github.io/PhysicsLearningGame/) to play it. 

The game tries to teach basic concepts from physics in a fun way. Players move around in interactive 2D environments where abstract concepts are continously displayed (e.g. as arrows). Players are prompted to investigate certain relations between these concepts as they play, and answer multiple-choice questions to check on their progress.

Note that the entire text in this game is in German. I thank the "MFG Stiftung Baden-Württemberg" for their support in developing this project. Feel free to download it (PhysicsLearningGame.capx in this repo), but note that it requires a paid version of Construct 2 or Construct 3. 

Note: This game furthermore needs and update as Chapter 4 does not start to run under Java 8.
