# ScirraConstruct-Examples
Some examples of what can be achieved with the Scirra Construct 2 or Construct 3 game engine

# Background
Scirra Construct 2 and Construct 3 are 2D game engines which allow to create simple games which can run in a browser. The engines are very beginner-friendly as they use visual scripting and only support a relatively modest range of functions compared to Unity and Unreal. Here I present some simple games I made with Construct 2.

# Examples
## Football 
A simple football game for two players. Click [here](https://mariusrubo.github.io/football/) to play it. 
The entire project is saved in the file football.capx in this repo. Its logic only consists of 33 events, so you can open the project even in the free version of Construct 2 and Construct 3 (100 events limit).
