# ScirraConstruct-Examples
Some example games made with the Scirra Construct 2 game engine

# Background
Scirra Construct 2 and Construct 3 are 2D game engines which allow to create simple games that run in a browser. The engines are rather beginner-friendly as they use visual scripting and only support a relatively modest range of functions compared to Unity and Unreal, but do allow to create some interesting applications. Here I present games I made with Construct 2 (it should be possible to also open the projects in Construct 3, which is backwards-compatible). 

# Examples
## Football 
A simple football game for two players. Click [here](https://mariusrubo.github.io/football/) to play it. 
The entire project is saved in the file football.capx in this repo. Its logic only consists of 33 events, so you can open the project even in the free version of Construct 2 and Construct 3 (100 events limit).

## Ms. Caterpillar
A physics-based platformer. Click [here](https://mariusrubo.github.io/Caterpillar/) to play it. 

This project is more complex and can only be run in paid versions of Construct 2 or Construct 3. Please contact me if you would like to use this project.

## Physics Learning Game
A learning game for basic Newtonian Mechanics and Kinematics. Click [here](https://mariusrubo.github.io/PhysicsLearningGame/) to play it. 

The game tries to show basic concepts in the field physics in a fun way. Players move around in interactive 2D environments where abstract concepts are continously displayed (e.g. as arrows). Players are prompted to investigate certain relations between these concepts as they play, and to then answer multiple-choice questions to check on their progress.

Note that the entire text in this game is in German. I thank the "MFG Stiftung Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg" for their support in developing this project. Note that it requires a paid version of Construct 2 or Construct 3 to open as a developer. 

Note: Chapter 4 currently does not start under Java 8.
